    text: Like most of the other students probably do, I have a small backlog of
      passion projects that I'd like to work on and I've been hoping that even if
      I wouldn't learn the things I would need to achieve them, I would at least
      take the first step on that road. That being said, when I first came into the
      course I have to admit I didn't really have any expectations. I thought that
      I would learn to program videogames but I didn't really have any other preconceptions
      about what that would entail or how it would happen. I had a vague idea of
      how videogames happened from having worked with Gamebryo and the Neverwinter
      Nights 2 level editor back in the early 2000s, but beyond some light modding
      work for Paradox Interactive games I've never really thought on a deeper level
      about what exactly needs to go into it.                                                                                       
      A couple weeks after orientation I started getting friendly with Tero, and
      with his help and guidance I feel that I really started to take off in my progress
      and understanding, as well as with my drive to learn more. In the early weeks
      he helped me a lot with getting a grasp on the basics when Jere was too busy
      to give help to everyone, and I have to admit I was more than a bit sad when
      Tero told me that he, understandably, tested out of BGP. This was, however,
      a good thing as it removed the crutch that I was leaning on and allowed me
      to use the skills that I had learned in a way that would actually cement them
      in my mind rather than always going to Tero for help.                                                               
      A few weeks later during the learn one teach one presentations, I was inspired
      again by Kristian's raycasting presentation and the work that he was able to
      put into the task. I knew that I wanted to work with him in the future, and
      I was really happy when I was able to join the group he made for Sprint Week
      because I knew he had a lot to teach me.                                                             
      I've said this before and I'll say it again, Sprint Week was the single best
      part of the course. Throughout the weeks I had found myself getting frustrated
      with the demo tasks and the creator kit and I never really knew why, but when
      my team got into swing with the Sprint Week project it hit me full force, that
      I was frustrated because THIS is what I had expected school to be like, it
      was what I had been wanting, and I absolutely loved it. As exhausting and stressful
      as it was, being able to look back at the experience at the end of the week
      and still want more was a galvinizing moment for me - I knew I'd chosen the
      right field for me, now I only had to rise to the task of becoming worthy of
      being a part of it.

    text: I had this feeling that Tero knew a lot and I wanted to work with him,
      but I knew that I would need to improve rapidly to be of any help working on
      a team with him. I feel like I've done that pretty admirably, I've managed
      to keep up with all of the demo tasks and even do the advanced tasks when time
      and family allowed, I've gone above and beyond on most of the assignments,
      and I've taken in as much information as is given to me on the side.                                                                                               
      I've grown familiar with the URP system and can convert assets, materials and
      projects as needed. Although I need more practice and understanding, I'm familiar
      with the post processing effects and what they are capable of doing - similarly
      I am also familiar with lighting in both the baked lighting and volumetric
      styles.  On the scripting side, I can create basic scripts proficiently and
      follow naming conventions as well as use an orderly structure within the code
      itself. I can create methods and call them from within the script or from a
      separate script. I know the difference between Arrays and Lists and I have
      a firm handle on basic variable types - both how and when to use them.                                                                                     
      I feel like I've accomplished a lot of learning in the span of one semester,
      and although my grade may not end up reflecting my progress I'm happy with
      the pace I've been keeping and I hope to expand my knowledge through use of
      Udemy courses and other materials. I have projects that I am working on and
      will continue to gain experience and knowledge through them, with the help
      of my teammates of course. I guess I'll close with saying thanks, it's nice
      to finally be doing something that I feel like has some meaning and purpose.
      Outside of raising my kids, I haven't really found that since I moved to Finland,
      so it's nice to feel like a contributing member of society again. Also, watching
      my oldest son play Project Void and be so happy and enthralled by a silly little
      game I helped make?                                                                           
      That's everything I could ever want.
